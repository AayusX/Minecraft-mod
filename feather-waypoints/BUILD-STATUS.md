# ATPoint Build Status

**Author: Mr.Aayush Bhandari**  
**Mod Name: ATPoint**

## ✅ What's Complete

1. **All Java source code** - 7 files implementing full waypoint functionality
2. **Mod metadata** - fabric.mod.json configured with ATPoint branding
3. **Resources** - Language files and placeholder for your custom logo
4. **Gradle configuration** - build.gradle with proper Fabric setup
5. **Your custom logo** - Atpoints.png successfully integrated (2.1MB)

## 🔧 Build Fix Applied

The `NoSuchFileException` was caused by Gradle trying to access missing plugin files. This has been resolved by:

1. ✅ Updated build.gradle to use stable fabric-loom version `1.2.+`
2. ✅ Added settings.gradle with proper plugin repositories
3. ✅ Simplified loom configuration to avoid environment issues
4. ✅ Fixed gradle wrapper configuration
